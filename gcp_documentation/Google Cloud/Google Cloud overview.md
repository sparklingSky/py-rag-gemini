This overview is designed to help you understand the overall landscape of
Google Cloud. You'll learn about how Google Cloud is structured,
how its functionality is provided as services, and the different ways that
you can interact with it when designing, creating, and running your applications.

As you explore the rest of this Get started section, you'll learn more about Google Cloud's tooling and resources, and how to get started creating and managing your own applications on Google Cloud.

For general information on cloud computing, see
[Advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing](https://cloud.google.com/learn/advantages-of-cloud-computing).

## Universes, regions, and zones

Underlying everything you do with Google Cloud technology
are the physical machines that run your workloads and Google Cloud
services. These machines live in data centers, and are logically structured into
universes, regions, and zones.

At the top of this hierarchy is the *universe*. A universe is a fully
self-contained cloud, with its own networking that is separate from the public
internet and other universes. Google Cloud is the original
universe, with resources in data centers all over the world. There are also other universes, based on the same technology as Google Cloud but with all their resources in a single jurisdiction and running in partner-operated datacenters. These self-contained smaller clouds are created as part of a program called Google Cloud Dedicated and provide strong data and operational sovereignty guarantees for users whose workloads require them.

Within each universe there are geographic *regions*. Google Cloud
has regions in
Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, North America, and South
America.

Finally, regions are divided into *zones* . Each zone is identified by a
name that combines a letter identifier with the name of the region. For example,
zone `a` in the East Asia region is named `asia-east1-a`. Zones have high-bandwidth,
low-latency network connections to other zones in the same region.

This distribution of resources in a universe into regions and zones provides several benefits, including redundancy
in case of failure and reduced latency by locating resources closer to clients.
This distribution also introduces some rules about how resources can be used
together.

## Global, regional, and zonal resources

Some resources can be accessed by any other resource in their universe, across regions and zones.
These *global resources* include preconfigured disk images, disk snapshots,
and networks. Some resources can be accessed only by
resources that are located in the same region. These *regional resources*
include static external IP addresses. Other resources can be accessed only by
resources that are located in the same zone. These *zonal resources* include VM
instances, their types, and disks.

The following diagram shows the relationship
between global scope, regions and zones, and some of their resources:

![A global network can contain region-specific resources such as IP
addresses and zone-specific resources such as VMs and disks.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/docs/images/overview/regions-zones.svg)

The scope of an operation varies depending on what kind of resources
you're working with. For example, creating a network is a global operation
because a network is a global resource, while reserving an IP address is a
regional operation because the address is a regional resource.

As you start to design and optimize your Google Cloud applications, it's important to
understand how these regions and zones interact. For example, even if you could,
you wouldn't want to attach a disk in one region to a computer in a different
region because the latency you'd introduce would make for poor performance.
Thankfully, Google Cloud won't let you do that; disks can only be attached
to computers in the same zone.

Depending on the level of self-management required for the
[computing and hosting service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/overview/cloud-platform-services#computing-hosting) you
choose, you might or might not need to think about how and where resources are
allocated.

For more information about the geographical distribution of Google Cloud,
see [Geography and Regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions).

## Accessing resources through services

In cloud computing, what you might be used to thinking of as software and
hardware products, become *services* . These services provide access to the
underlying resources, letting you add a wide range of functionality---from
managed Kubernetes to data storage---to your applications. You can see the list
of available Google Cloud services in our
[product list](https://cloud.google.com/products/).

When you develop your website or application on
Google Cloud, you mix and match these services into combinations that
provide the infrastructure you need, and then add your code to enable the
scenarios you want to build.

## Projects

Any Google Cloud resources that you allocate and use must belong to a
project. You can think of a project as the organizing entity for what you're
building. A project is made up of the settings, permissions, and other metadata
that describe your applications. Resources within a single project can work
together easily, for example by communicating through an internal network,
subject to the regions-and-zones rules. A project can't access another project's
resources unless you use [Shared VPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) or
[VPC Network Peering](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering).

Each Google Cloud project has the following:

- A project name, which you provide.
- A project ID, which you can provide or Google Cloud can provide for you.
- A project number, which Google Cloud provides.

So, for example, the same project might have:

- The project name **Example Project**
- The project ID **example-id**
- The project number **123456789012**

As you work with Google Cloud, you use these
identifiers in commands and API calls. For example, you might specify that you
want to use the project as your default for the Google Cloud CLI with the
following command:

    gcloud config set project example-id

You can create multiple projects and use them to separate your work in whatever
way makes sense for you and your organization. For example, you might have one project that can be
accessed by all team members and a separate project that can only be accessed by
certain team members.

A project serves as a namespace. This means every resource within each project
must have a unique name, but you can usually reuse resource names if they are in
separate projects. Some resource names must be unique within Google Cloud. Refer to the documentation for the resource for details.

Each project is associated with one billing account. Multiple projects can have
their resource usage billed to the same account.

[Creating and managing projects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

## Interacting with Google Cloud

There are multiple ways to interact with resources and services in Google Cloud, including the following:

- The [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) provides a web-based, graphical user interface that you can use to manage your Google Cloud projects and resources.
- The [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) lets you manage development workflow and Google Cloud resources directly from the command line. For example, you can create a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance by running the `gcloud compute instances create` command in your shell environment. You can choose between installing the Google Cloud CLI on your local machine, or using it in [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/features), a convenient browser-based shell that you can access from the Google Cloud console and which has many tools pre-installed.
- Our provided [client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained) help you to interact with services programmatically in a variety of popular languages. Cloud Client Libraries provide an optimized developer experience by using each supported language's natural conventions and styles. They also reduce the boilerplate code you have to write because they're designed to enable you to work with service metaphors in mind, rather than implementation details or service API concepts.
- You can use an "infrastructure as code" (IaC) approach by using [Terraform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform) and the Google Cloud Terraform provider.
