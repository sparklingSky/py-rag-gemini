This document describes the [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined)
that are designed to be granted to users with specific job functions in Google Cloud.

When granting access to Google Cloud resources, you might not know which
service-specific IAM roles your users need. Instead, you might
know their general job function---for example, database administrator or site
reliability engineer. To make it easier to give these users the permissions that
they need, Identity and Access Management (IAM) offers predefined roles that are designed
for specific job functions. These roles contain all of the permissions typically
required to access the services that are relevant to a certain job function.
Assign these roles to the users in your Google Cloud organization whose
responsibilities align most with the job functions described on this page.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Predefined roles for job functions are typically less granular than other predefined roles. If your organization has strict standards for secure access management, consider using more granular [predefined
> roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/choose-predefined-roles) or creating [custom
> roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles).
